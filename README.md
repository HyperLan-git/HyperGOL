# HyperGOL
This is a tribute to John Conway's well known Game Of Life. It's a fun cellular automaton that generates any cool pattern you want from different starting conditions.
You need to pause the simulation and then click on tiles to turn them black (alive) and the rules of the game will make them grow or die in seemingly unpredictable patterns.
I know Conway should be remembered for his other cooler works but that's what I made so you're not getting anything else.
